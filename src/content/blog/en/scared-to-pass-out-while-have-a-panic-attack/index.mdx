## My first experience with fainting
About ten years ago, I experienced what I call "fainting" for the first time in my life. Although, to be honest, the "falling" part didn’t really happen. 
It occurred in a crowded bar while watching a football match. The room was stifling, and the heat from the crowd made it almost unbearable for me.

Suddenly, I felt dizzy and lightheaded. I decided to walk outside for some fresh air, but my legs weren’t cooperating. 
I stumbled along the wall, trying to keep myself upright. Thankfully, a friend noticed and helped me get outside.

## The frightening experience that followed
Once outside, my friend and a passerby held me up by my arms. They had no idea what was happening and didn’t realize I was fainting. 
They didn’t consider that fainting serves a purpose: when you lie down, blood can flow back to your brain. 
But because they kept me upright, I remained in a sort of trance. I could hear sounds and voices around me as if a glass dome covered my head, but I couldn’t respond.

This happened several times—I would briefly regain consciousness for a few seconds but couldn’t speak properly. 
The helplessness was terrifying, something I never want to experience again. 
I had completely lost control over my body.

## Fainting during a panic attack is rare 
Whenever I feel dizzy or lightheaded again, the fear strikes that it’s happening all over. 
It’s the fear of losing control over my body. While it’s rare to faint during a panic attack, it feels exactly the same: dizziness, instability, as if you could collapse any second. 
These sensations are normal during a panic attack, which makes it even more frightening because it mimics real fainting.

## How I cope with this fear
One thing that helps me tremendously is remembering that panic attacks are not dangerous. The symptoms are intense, but you won’t actually faint. 
Knowing that it’s temporary brings a sense of calm.

Another method that helps is staying present in the moment. I engage my senses by touching things around me. 
For example, I focus on how my clothing feels: how rough is the fabric of my jeans? How soft is my sweater?

I also start counting things—whether it’s my breaths or objects around me. How many plants do I see? How many red cars are passing by? 
This shifts my focus from fear to the present.

## Learning to trust your body
Perhaps the hardest step is feeling your body. 
During a panic attack, your body feels uncomfortable—your heart races, your breathing is shallow, and you might experience tingling in your limbs. This can be scary, but it’s normal and will pass. By learning that your body isn’t your enemy, you can gradually reduce the fear. 
You don’t have to run from what you’re feeling.

It’s a process, but each time I go through these steps, I come out stronger in the end.
