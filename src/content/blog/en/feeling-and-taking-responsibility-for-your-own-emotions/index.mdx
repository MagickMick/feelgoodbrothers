Everyone has experienced intense emotions or desires that seem difficult to control. 
It can feel like you have no control, especially when you place the cause of those feelings outside yourself. 
But what if you could learn to recognize, accept, and actually manage your emotions? In this blog, we dive deeper into this idea.

## You have the ability to manage your emotions and desires by making them "yours." 
They are already yours, but you may not realize it because you often place the power or blame outside yourself.

Let me explain this better with an example. You’ve been irritated by someone for a while. 
Besides the thoughts, it’s also a real physical feeling in your body. Often, the thought is the cause of the physical sensation.

However, you can choose not to feel this physical sensation, and thus the irritation, so intensely. 
How do you do that? Focus your attention on the feeling. What exactly do you feel? Where in your body is it located? 
I often feel the sensation most strongly just below my ribs, at the top of my stomach.

Accept that it’s there and just **observe** it. It doesn’t need to go away. By giving it loving attention, you’ll notice that it naturally becomes calmer.
This also applies to desire. Sometimes we wish for something and patiently wait for the moment we receive it. 
We set goals and look to the outside world, hoping that an external force will bring us our goal. But here too, you can take control. Take charge and achieve what you want from **within**.

We often search for happiness outside of ourselves, but true happiness lies within. 
Imagine that you already possess the result of your desires. Want more money or to be happier? Feel your body as if you already have it.

If, in the future, you truly are happier or have the money you dream of, you will still feel the same body. 
And that is all that matters. Through this, you realize that you already have what you wish for. This is pure awareness.
