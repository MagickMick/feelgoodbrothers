      Welcome to our blog! We are three Dutch brothers sharing our personal experiences with mental health challenges. From anxiety and panic attacks to depression, ADD, derealization, and much more, we’ve faced various mental struggles throughout our lives, by ourself or in our family. We’re not professionals, but we are individuals who have lived through these challenges and found ways to cope.
<br><br>
<b>Our story</b><br>
We come from a family where mental health has always been a part of our lives. Growing up with separated parents and a mother who has struggled with depression, we’ve had our fair share of challenges. Mental health issues can often feel overwhelming, but through our experiences, we’ve learned that it’s something many people deal with, even if it’s not always visible.
<br><br>
We’ve had our ups and downs, and we know firsthand how overwhelming mental health struggles can be. But we’ve also learned that sharing our stories can help others realize they are not alone. This blog is our way of opening up and offering support to others who might be going through similar situations.
<br><br>
Each of us has dealt with different mental health issues, and we each have our own methods of managing and coping. We talk openly about how we’ve handled things like panic attacks, moments of derealization, the struggle with depression, and how we use mindfulness, yoga, and other self-care practices to stay grounded.
<br><br>
<b>Our purpose</b><br>
The goal of this blog is simple: to inform, support, and encourage. We want to provide valuable insights from our own experiences, showing that mental health struggles are not something to be ashamed of, and they certainly don’t define us. We aim to create a space where people can feel understood, whether they are looking for advice, a sense of community, or just a reminder that they’re not alone in their battles.
<br><br>
As the blog grows, we’ll continue to share more personal stories and advice, and eventually, we hope to invite others to share their own experiences as well. Our goal is to create a space where open conversations about mental health are encouraged, and people feel empowered to take control of their own mental well-being.
<br><br>
<b>Why we started this blog</b><br>
We started this blog because we knew that many people feel like they’re carrying the weight of their struggles alone. The more we talked about our own issues, the more we realized that mental health challenges are a lot more common than we thought. By sharing our personal experiences, we hope to create a sense of connection and understanding. For us it is also a kind of therapy.
<br><br>
We know that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for mental health, but we believe that by being open and honest about our experiences, we can help others feel seen and heard.
<br><br>
<b>Our approach</b><br>
Over time, we’ve found ways to live with our mental health challenges, but we’re the first to admit that they’re often still there. While some days are better than others, the struggles don’t disappear completely. However, we’ve learned that it’s not about eradicating mental health issues entirely, but rather about finding strategies to live with them. Life, of course, has its ups and downs, but we believe that’s just part of the human experience—and it’s okay. Life is full of both beautiful and challenging moments, and that balance is something we’ve come to accept.
<br><br>
We want to make it clear that we are not mental health professionals, but just people sharing what we’ve learned from our own experiences. While we’ve found certain coping strategies helpful, we strongly recommend speaking with therapists, psychologists, or other mental health professionals for guidance. We’ve both been in therapy ourselves and believe it’s an essential part of the healing process.
<br><br>
Thank you for visiting, and we hope you find something here that resonates with you.
